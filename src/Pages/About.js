                        We at <strong>Ariya</strong> believe that the world is moving towards to a commoditized use of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the pace of that transition is much faster than is actually known to the common man. The jobs we know today may not exist in their current form in the near future. And new businesses and ventures will come in to change how life is lived. Having the basic understanding and skillsets for these technologies will become an essential tool in oneâ€™s arsenal, if it is not one already.

                        Kids operate at genius level very early in their life. Their abiliy to learn new things is only limited by the opportunities afforded to them. Python was originally created 20 years ago to make it possible for kids to learn coding. We believe that by starting early, they are obtaining skills that they will anyway need during their years of higher education.

                        We believe the world is moving towards a skillset model, and less reliance is being placed on formal certifications and education. Proof of this is in the fact that jobs in AI and ML today are based on what you know in that field, because formal degrees and certifications that specialize in AI and ML are not fully developed yet. This a field with scope for mathematicians, statisticians, engineers and scientists from all branches. We can be the springboard you need to jumpstart a career in this field.
